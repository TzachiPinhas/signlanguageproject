# Sign Language Recognition Web Application

This web application uses TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe to recognize sign language gestures in real-time through a webcam.

## Machine Learning Model Information

### Model Types

The application can use three types of models:

1. **Mock Model (Default for Testing)**: A simple TensorFlow.js model used for UI testing.
2. **Pre-converted TensorFlow.js Model**: A model hosted remotely or locally that's already in TensorFlow.js format.
3. **Converted Keras Model**: A model that needs to be converted from Keras format to TensorFlow.js format.

### Model Configuration

In `src/hooks/useSignLanguageModel.js`, you can configure which model to use:

```javascript
const MODEL_URL = {
  TFJS_MODEL: "https://storage.googleapis.com/sign-language-models-tfjs/model.json", // Replace with your model URL
  LOCAL_MODEL: "/models/sign_language_model/model.json" // Local model path
};

// Set to false when you have a real model available
const USE_MOCK_MODEL = true;
```

### Model Conversion

To convert a Keras model to TensorFlow.js format, see [MODEL_CONVERSION.md](./MODEL_CONVERSION.md)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
